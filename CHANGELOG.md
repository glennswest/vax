  - Literal (modes 0-3)
  - Indexed (mode 4)
  - Register (mode 5)
  - Register deferred (mode 6)
  - Autodecrement (mode 7)
  - Autoincrement (mode 8)
  - Autoincrement deferred (mode 9)

  - Deferred modes
- PC-relative addressing support
- Automatic register updates for auto-increment/decrement

#### CPU Architecture Improvements
- **New CPU implementation: `vax_cpu_v2.vhd`**
- Proper state machine: Fetch → Decode → Operand Fetch → Execute → Writeback
- Larger instruction buffer (256 bits for long instructions)
- Support for two-byte opcodes (FD, FE, FF prefixes)
- Processor register implementation:
  - Stack pointers: KSP, ESP, SSP, USP
  - Page table registers: P0BR, P0LR, P1BR, P1LR, SBR, SLR
  - System registers: SCBB, PCBB
- MTPR/MFPR fully functional for all processor registers
- Branch target calculation
- Condition code evaluation

#### Operand Fetching Integration ⭐ CRITICAL MILESTONE
- **New CPU implementation: `vax_cpu_v3.vhd`**
- **Complete integration of addressing mode decoder with CPU execution pipeline**
- Multi-operand instruction handling (up to 6 operands per instruction)
- Memory arbitration between instruction fetch, operand fetch, and execution
- Register and memory operand support
- Auto-increment/decrement register updates
- Proper writeback to both registers and memory
- Support for all 16 addressing modes during operand fetch
- Removes the main blocker for VAX instruction execution

#### New Features
- **Branch Instructions:** All 15 conditional branches working
  - BEQL, BNEQ, BGTR, BLEQ, BGEQ, BLSS
  - BGTRU, BLEQU (unsigned comparisons)
  - BCC, BCS, BVC, BVS
  - BRB, BRW (unconditional)
- **Subroutine Support:** JSB/RSB implemented
- **Privileged Instructions:** MTPR/MFPR operational
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Full 2-operand and 3-operand support
- **Logical Operations:** BIS, BIC, XOR all sizes
